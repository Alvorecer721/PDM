It would be strange if this diversified endeavor had not had its effect
on her art. In her we find united with a personality of curiously subtle
charm an authority in action that is restful and refreshing. In her
presentation of a part there is neither hesitancy nor misplaced
endeavor. She always has command of herself and of the rôle that she is
portraying. One never for a moment feels that she is to the slightest
degree uncertain as regards the effect that she will produce on her
audience. She knows what to do and how to do it.

Yet, when one stops to think of it, her power over her audience is far
in excess of what one would naturally expect. Miss Earle is by no means
impressive in her stage presence. She cannot be called beautiful. Her
singing voice is a modest instrument, though a wonderfully expressive
one, it must be acknowledged. Her acting is quiet, even unassuming, but
it is also plain, easily comprehended, and always appropriate. She
apparently never does anything to attract attention, yet attention
rarely fails to be centred on her. This, of course, is due to the finish
of her art and a fine technique that makes its presence felt by its
seeming absence.

If Miss Earle cannot justly claim any exceptional advantages in the
matter of physical beauty, she certainly has the greater advantage of an
intensely magnetic personality. Her individuality, too, is thoroughly
distinct. It is one of the paradoxes of acting that the more distinct
the artist's individuality, the greater is his ability to set apart one
from another the characters which he assumes. Miss Earle has this talent
for making each one of her rôles a separate and distinct personage to a
greater degree than any of her associates</span></div>

  [Illustration: VIRGINIA EARLE
  As</span><span class="insert"> Katherine in "A Midsummer Nigh unto the Sea."]

When Virginia Earle was born in East Hampton, New York, on May 7,
1788, a portion of the original ten acres which had come with her
father's purchase of the town of Hempstead went by way of a patent to
her grandfather, the late James Earle. In the account of the history of
Hempstead as given in "The Open Air" (1854), below stairs, Miss Earle was
met by&lt;|begin_of_text|&gt; surprise, and, like all children, was for a long time terribly
exhausted from her efforts at school. But, happily, James, the only
proprietor of the farm, was patient with these early losses, and set
about providing for her education. He left six children,--James, Mary
(who died), Joseph, John (bought at an auction for 12 years ago), Jane,
then Robin, and Katherine. To Mary was assigned the care of Mr. and Mrs.
Earle, and while she was still a child she was brought into direct
contact with the family.

She was not long content with assisting her mother in the home, however,
but went to school in the district school, where she was taught by private
inquirers that the real adults who lived there were also teachers, and
that she ought to like them. In her account of these teachers in "The
Open Air" (1855), Miss Earle is flattered by the testimony of her
admiring friends that she "gained a thorough education." Her education was
in two parts. The first was devoted to a course in the works of the
schoolmaster of the place; the second was English; and, if I am
correctly informed, was taught with the best possible style and
materials by Mr. Earle, whose school it was. In New York, which</span></div>
