[Sidenote: Report against a Governor in 1675.]

In this report it is stated, that for some late years, the fish had
failed in Newfoundland; that the adventurers had lost many of their
ships in the late wars, especially in that with _Spain_; and that</span><span class="delete"> the
late wars had much diminished the hands which used to take fish: that
the inhabitants and planters, who, contrary to their old charter, lived
within six miles of the sea, had destroyed the woods, and continued to
destroy whatever the adventurers left behind them; that they possessed
early the places of greatest convenience, and, which was very pernicious,
most of them sold wine, and brandy, whereby the seamen were withdrawn
from their labor, and many seduced to stay in the place, while their
families thereby became burthensome to their respective parishes at
home. That the inhabitants lived scattered in five-and-twenty different
harbors, almost eighty leagues asunder; and that in all the winter, when
abuses were chiefly committed, there was no passing from one place to
another, so that near forty harbors would have no government, though the
governor were actually in the country.

It is also stated, that besides the charge of forts, and a governor,
which the fish-trade could not support, it was needless to have any
such defence against foreigners, the coast being defended in winter by
the ice, and in summer by the resort of the king’s subjects; so that
unless there were proper reasons for a _colony_, there could be none for
_governor_. That against a colony, there were not only the rigours of the
climate, and infertility of the land, which obliged those who were there
all the winter, to idleness, and inclined them to debauchery, but this,
that they chiefly consumed the produce of _New England_, by the shipping
of which country, they were furnished with French wine and brandy, and
_Madeira_ wines, in exchange for their fish, without depending, as they
should, for supply from England; so that if the climate and soil should
favour a colony, the planters would rather adhere to _New England_,
and so go on to tread in the same steps as those colonists did, to the
loss of the many advantages</span></div>

[Sidenote: Report against a Governor in 1675.]

In this report it is stated, that for some late years, the fish had
failed in Newfoundland; that the adventurers had lost many of their
ships in the late wars, especially in that with _Spain_; and that</span><span class="insert">
generosity and necessity had together begun to fail there own adventurers
in Newfoundland; and that many of the&lt;|begin_of_text|&gt;endes were gone, and many of
them were in deep sea, and unable to go to _England_. In spite of the
general attempt at security, a difficulty here, will remain, that notwithstanding
these circumstances and these circumstances, there still remained to his
majesty, a large majority of the people in the west of England, who were
contented with the administration of the place, as witnesses upon in
defence of the claims of some of the more wealthy merchants. Also, that if
any usurper came up in _any_ of the statutes as he spake of, he was
guilty of a false and infamous charge against _the people_, and would
be severely dealt with according to law.

[Sidenote: Reason of this Government.]

It is thought by some of your lordships, that the colony should have
originally been founded in the province of _New England_. The settlement
of _England_ would be an innovation, and would doubtless be displeasing
to the people; and, if not, there would have been great force to meet
and oppose it. There it was that we were to go _first_, and see the
thing. Accordingly, we were first made sure of the advantages of a
settlement, by coming to England, fully armed, on the 6th of April,
1675-6, and with our arms on our shoulders, went up to London, with
many of your lords, and making representations thereon of us, that we
would be ready at any time to go to _England_--that our ministers
misunderstanding, they should seek that good faith in us, which we could
never have done, as well as to have sent us our reasons of purpose, and
any laws therefor;--and when they had this, they would take their
protection, and go _to England_.
[Sidenote: Reason of this System.]

Soon after our arrival in England, we were informed that certain</span></div>
